<h2>How long does it take to deliver China Post ?</h2>
<p>The delivery times provided by China Post can vary from 7 days to 3 months, depending on the dimensions of the package, including its size and weight. The country of destination as well as the degree of urgency of the shipment will also influence the time needed to ensure its delivery.</p>
<p>China Post's international services handle small packages, large parcels or express courier service (EMS Epacket).</p>
<p>The classification of packages depends on the specificities of weight and size, it will be necessary to ensure the type of package thanks to the following information:</p>
<p>The weight of the package:</p>
<ul>
    <li>is considered as a small package, any shipment whose weight does not exceed 2kg</li>
    <li>is considered a large package, any shipment weighing between 2kg and 30kg</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful, the maximum weight for large packages may be limited for some countries. The weight is limited to 20kg for packages sent to the following countries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, South Africa, Norway, Belgium, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Malaysia, India, Chile, Egypt, Ukraine, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Philippines</li>
    <li>The weight of the packages is limited to 15kg for delivery to Poland.</li>
    <li>The weight of the packages is limited to 40kg for Singapore.</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the package:</p>
<ul>
    <li>up to 30kg, packages must comply with the following dimensions: less than 1.5 meters in length and less than 3 meters in width</li>
    <li>up to 20kg, packages must comply with the following dimensions: less than 1.05 meters in length and less than 2 meters in width</li>
    <li>the minimum size of the packages must respect the following dimensions: greater than 0.24 meters in length and 0.16 meters in width</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the size of the packages affects delivery times because large shipments are not prioritized for shipment, so they may take longer for their delivery.</p>
<p>The air delivery methods via China Air Parcel and Surface Air Lift generally ensure an estimated time between 5 and 30 days for the receipt of the package. The last one, for surface packages, can take up to more than a month.</p>
<p>The estimated delivery times for each mode of delivery are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>transport by air:
        <ul>
            <li>to countries bordering China: from 5 to 10 days</li>
            <li>to Europe and the United States: 7 to 16 days</li>
            <li>to Latin America: 10 to 20 days</li>
            <li>to Africa, and other countries or regions: 15 to 30 days</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>for air parcels Surface Air Lift: from 15 to 20 days whatever the country of destination</li>
    <li>for surface packages: from 1 to 2 months whatever the country of destination</li>
    <li>for packages ePacket: 10 to 20 days to the United States, the shipping time may be longer for other recipient countries, due to the time it is taken to get to the appropriate structures before it can be sent to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>However, delays in delivery and an extended delay may be observed; due to variable weather conditions, holiday periods, possible customs inspections and possible errors in the transmission of the recipient's contact details.</p>

<p>Officially known as China Post Group Corporation, China Post, or Chinese La Poste , is the official operational postal transit service in China. It provides postal services for the entire national territory, with the exception of Hong Kong and Macau.</p>
<p>China Post was established in 1949, and takes over from Chunghwa Post which was the main player in the postal service of mainland China until then.</p>

It has also reassured customers by offering several shipping options while ensuring follow-up, which has helped to strengthen the confidence of consumers both individuals and professionals.</p>
<p>The ePacket agreements have been extended to other territories, which want more efficient and effective access to the US market.</p>

    <li>the value of the item sent must not exceed $400 (338.60 euros)</li>
</ul>
